- The interface for the make file is not changed with respect to the planetlab 4.x kernel. So it should just work out of the box on the build system.

- To compile a new kernel rpm, just type (the order of srpm and rpm matters)
$make srpm rpm

- Look at sources file to know where the base kernel rpm is downloaded from

- planetlab-patches.in is empty right now. New patches should be specified here. They will be automatically included on the spec file.

- config-planetlab file holds specific configuration variables for the kernel. Right now, we are using the default configuration provided by Fedora.
